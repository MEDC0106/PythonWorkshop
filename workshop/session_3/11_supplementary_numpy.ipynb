    "### What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "[**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/) is a widely-used Python package that provides multidimensional array and matrix data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the [NumPy User Guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source Python library that’s essential in nearly every field of science and engineering. It serves as the standard for numerical data handling in Python and forms the foundation of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy is used by everyone from beginner coders to advanced researchers engaged in scientific and industrial R&D. Its API is integral to other key data science libraries, including Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy enables scientists and engineers to develop high-performance software with the simplicity of Python and speeds close to those of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore the basics of NumPy. This library’s versatility and depth could easily merit an entire lecture series! \n",

    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays can only hold one type of data, unlike Python lists.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays consume less memory than Python lists.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays are much faster than Python lists.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays have a fixed size.\n",
    "- NumPy provides numerous fast mathematical operations that can be applied over arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The structure of an array\n",
    "\n",
    "The array is the core data structure in the NumPy library, consisting of a grid of values that all share the same data type, or `dtype`. This grid can be indexed similarly to Python lists, as well as by tuples of nonnegative integers, by Booleans, by another NumPy array, or by integers.\n",

    "**Multiple dimensions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays can also be multi-dimensional (1D, 2D, 3D ... ND), which means they can be used to model vectors (1D) and matrices (2D). Arrays with three or more dimensions are often referred to as tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, dimensions are referred to as \"axes\". A 2D array might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[0., 0., 0.],\n",
    " [1., 1., 1.]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, there are two axes: the first axis has a length of two, and the second has a length of three. You can access the shape of an array with the `.shape` attribute, which is a tuple representing the length of each axis. In this case, the shape would be `(2, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating NumPy arrays:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to create a NumPy array. Here are some common methods:\n",

    "- `np.array()`\n",
    "- `np.zeros()`\n",

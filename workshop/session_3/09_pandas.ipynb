    "# 09 - Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "*Written by:* Oliver Scott\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook provides a general introduction to Pandas.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to modify the code cells to see how things work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** is a powerful Python package for data analysis, offering functions for analysing, cleaning, and manipulating data. It is one of the most crucial tools for data scientists and forms the backbone of many Python-based data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data manipulation with Pandas is often the first step before further analysis using other Python packages, such as:\n",
    "- **[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)** for statistical analysis,\n",
    "- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** for data visualization,\n",
    "- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)** for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are part of the Python scientific stack, essential for informatics or data science careers. To be effective in Pandas, it is helpful to have a solid understanding of core Python concepts (as covered in the first session) and some familiarity with NumPy (covered in the supplementary notebook for Session 3). If any concepts are challenging, reviewing previous notebooks might be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the basics of Pandas. While Pandas is a comprehensive library that could fill an entire course, here we’ll focus on fundamental concepts to get you started and provide a foundation for further learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas has two core components, the `Series` and the `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Series` can be imagined as a single column in a data table, whereas the `DataFrame` can be imagined as a full data table made up of multiple `Series`. Both types have a similar interface allowing the user to perform similar operations. DataFrames are similar to spreadsheets that you may have interacted with in software such as Excel. DataFrames are often faster, easier to use and more powerful than spreadsheets.\n",

    "## Creating DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to create a DataFrame in Pandas. In most cases it is likely that you will want to read in data from a particular file, however DataFrames can also be constructed from scratch from lists, tuples, NumPy arrays or Pandas Series. One of the simplest ways to create a DataFrame is from a Python dictionary, where keys become column names and values become the column data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to construct a table like the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| PatientID | Gender | Age | Outcome  |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|-----|----------|\n",
    "| 556785    | M      | 19  | Negative |\n",
    "| 998764    | F      | 38  | Positive |\n",
    "| 477822    | M      | 54  | Positive |\n",
    "| 678329    | M      | 22  | Negative |\n",
    "| 675859    | F      | 41  | Negative |\n",

    "### What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Numpy**](https://numpy.org/) is a popular python package containing multidimensional array and matrix data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Description from the [NumPy user guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy allows scientists to produce cutting edge software with the speed of C with a much less involved API!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn the very basics of the NumPy, it could have a whole lecture series itself! \n",

    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays can only hold one 'type' of data unlike Python lists\n",
    "- NumPy arrays consume less memory than Python lists\n",
    "- NumPy arrays are much faster then Python lists\n",
    "- NumPy arrays are of a fixed size\n",
    "- NumPy provides numerous (fast) mathematical operations that can be applied over arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The structure of an array\n",
    "\n",
    "The array is the fundamental data structure in the NumPy library, consisting of a grid of values which all share the same 'type' or 'dtype' in NumPy. This grid can be indexed in a similar way to Python lists, and also using tuples of nonnegative integers, by booleans, by another array, or by integers. \n",

    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays can also be multidimensional (1D, 2D, 3D ... ND), meaning the NumPy array structure can be used to model vectors (1D) and matrices (2D). Arrays with >= 3 dimensions is often refered to as a tensor (see above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions in NumPy are refered to as 'axes'. A 2D array may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[0., 0., 0.],\n",
    " [1., 1., 1.]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where there are two axes and the first axis has a length of two and the second a length of three. You can access the shape of an array with the `.shape` attribute, which is a tuple refering to the length of each axis. In this case this would be `(2,3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating NumPy arrays:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to create a NumPy array. We will cover some of the ways here:\n",

    "The code line `translated = coordinates + vector` works although the arrays shapes are different: `(4, 3)` and `(3,)`, due to broadcasting. The line works as though the shape of the vector is also `(4, 3)` where the vector is copied 3 times and the summation is performed elementwise (*NumPy is clever anough not to actually copy the arrays to remain super-efficient*)\n",

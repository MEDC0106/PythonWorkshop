    "*Written by:* Mateusz Kaczyński\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook provides a general introduction to Biopython library and an in-depth look at dealing with the sequences - the cornerstone of bioinformatics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Biopython?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biopython** is a popular open-source toolbox for computational biology and bioinformatics. It contains tools and connectors for various resources and provides functions for running common bioinformatics tasks and parsing common bioinformatics data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Biopython?\n",
    "**Biopython** is a de-facto standard for accessing a lot of the databases and tools making it easier to share your work and results. It simplifies the use of the libraries written in other languages and technologies as well as those hosted online. While it is possible to use those directly - Biopython simplifies the process and provides the components you. \n",

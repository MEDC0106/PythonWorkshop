    "### What is Biopython?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biopython** is a widely-used, open-source toolkit for computational biology and bioinformatics. It includes tools, resource connectors, and functions for executing standard bioinformatics tasks and parsing common data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parsing is just a fancier word for interpreting or analyzing data to extract meaningful information.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Biopython?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biopython** is the de facto standard for accessing numerous bioinformatics databases and tools, making it easier to share your work and results. It simplifies interaction with libraries written in other languages and technologies, as well as those hosted online. While it is possible to use these resources directly, Biopython streamlines the process and provides the essential components you need.\n",

    "We have covered the initial steps of the ***central dogma of molecular biology***: transcribing DNA into RNA and then translating it into a protein sequence. The final step, i.e. converting a sequence into a protein structure, is known as **protein folding**. This process is considerably more complex and computationally expensive to predict.\n",

    "One method that has recently gained prominence is **[AlphaFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2)**. It predicts protein structures based on known folding patterns and sequence alignments, using deep learning techniques to achieve remarkable accuracy. \n",
    "The **[2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03214-7)** was awarded to John Jumper and Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind for developing this AI tool, and to David Baker for his work on computational protein design. Their contributions have revolutionised biology and hold the potential to transform drug discovery.\n",

    "In this notebook, we explored fundamental ways to construct and manipulate sequences, including transcription and translation. We examined how **Biopython** facillitates *sequence alignment*, both pairwise and multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and demonstrated how to *download and read FASTA files* to access sequence records and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides only an introduction to the extensive tools and integrations available within the **Biopython** library, which supports a wide range of formats and methods for storing and processing sequence and alignment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, this notebook uses very simple sequences. In real-world applications, sequences are often much longer and more complex. We encourage you to revisit this notebook with longer sequences and to experiment with the code to gain a deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now move on to the exercise notebook which will allow you to use the code introduced here in more practical scenarios.\n",

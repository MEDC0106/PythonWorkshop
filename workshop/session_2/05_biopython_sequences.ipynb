    "\n",
    "*Written by:* Mateusz Kaczyński\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook provides a general introduction to Biopython library and an in-depth look at dealing with the sequences - the cornerstone of bioinformatics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Biopython?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biopython** is a popular open-source toolbox for computational biology and bioinformatics. It contains tools and connectors for various resources and provides functions for running common bioinformatics tasks and parsing common bioinformatics data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Biopython?\n",
    "**Biopython** is a de-facto standard for accessing a lot of the databases and tools making it easier to share your work and results. It simplifies the use of the libraries written in other languages and technologies as well as those hosted online. While it is possible to use those directly - Biopython simplifies the process and provides you with the components you need. \n",

    "This notebook only touches on the tools and integrations provided with **Biopython** library, the plethora of formats and tools that can be used to store and process sequences and alignment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook relied on very simple toy sequences. In practice, this is unrealistic. Try going through this notebook using longer, more representative sequences and experimenting with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise section that accompanies this notebook will allow you to use the code here in more practical scenarios.\n",

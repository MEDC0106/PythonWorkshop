    "\n",
    "*Written by:* Oliver Scott\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook provides a general introduction to Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be afraid to make changes to the code cells to explore how things work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a popular general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is paticularly popular amongst the scientific community due to it's inherent readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web development (server-side),\n",
    "- Software development,\n",
    "- System scripting,\n",
    "- Science,\n",
    "- Much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter** is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data exploration and visualisation\n",
    "- Numerical simulation\n",
    "- Statistical modeling\n",
    "- Machine learning\n",
    "- Much more!\n",

    "### Variables and Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are one of the most important components of a programming languyage. Variables are used to store information. This gives a short hand notation to refer to potentially very large amounts of information!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign data to variables using the `=` symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "`variable = data`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have assigned data to a variable we can then access that data using the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming a variable it is best practice to give it a name which describes the data it holds. We use underscores `_` to make variable names easier to read (spaces cannot be used) e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "`my_long_variable_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that Python contains keywords that **should not** be used as variable names. This is because they have explicit functions in Python. In this editor (Jupyter) you will be able to tell a keyword when it is automatically highlighted. Alternatively [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) is a list of reserved keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Python is a dynamically typed language and therfore the type of a variable does not need to be specified. If you are familiar with statically typed languages (e.g. c, c++, Java) this may seem a little unusual.*"

    "# 03 - Modules and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "*Written by:* Oliver Scott\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook provides a general introduction to using modules and packages in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be afraid to make changes to the code cells to explore how things work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a **module** is a part of software that contains code for a specific function. When developing large projects, breaking code into modules helps keep it **readable** and **maintainable**. For example, if we were building a game, one module might handle physics, while another manages what is rendered on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is simply a file with a `.py` extension, containing functions, variables, and classes. When we import this code into Python, we use the name of the file without the extension. For example, a file called *test.py* defines a module, and its corresponding name in Python would be *test*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes a relatively large collection of useful modules, such as `math`; however, we can also define our own modules or download them from a third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are simply collections of modules and other packages, organised within a directory. To qualify as a package, a special `__init__.py` file must be present, indicating that the directory defines a package. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "audio/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    formats/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        mp3.py\n",
    "        wav.py\n",
    "    effects/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        echo.py\n",
    "        fade.py  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure above defines a package named `audio`, which contains two sub-packages: `formats` and `effects`. The `formats` package includes two modules, `mp3` and `wav`, while the `effects` package contains the modules `echo` and `fade`. In this notebook, we won’t dwell on package structures, but it’s useful to understand their layout. If you’d like to learn more about creating and structuring packages, consider exploring the extra resources linked below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes an extensive [collection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) of modules and packages that are valuable to any programmer. Becoming familiar with the standard library is essential, as it offers solutions to many common programming tasks, enabling you to solve problems quickly without writing new code. A helpful guide to the standard library is available on the Python website [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/stdlib.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third-party extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library, while extensive, is not exhaustive. Additional components can be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI), where you’ll find everything from individual modules and packages to complete application development frameworks. The scientific community also frequently uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which allows easy installation of complex packages, including those with compiled code (e.g., C, C++, Rust). If you are viewing these notebooks through Binder, it has already installed several third-party packages that we will use in these sessions.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from audio.formats import wav\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could then use functions defined in wav:\n",

    "# 03 - Modules and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "*Written by:* Oliver Scott\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook provides a general introduction to using modules and packages in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be afraid to make changes to the code cells to explore how things work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming a **module** is part of a piece of software contating code that has a specific function. When developing large projects breaking code into modules helps keep the code **readble** and **maintainable**. For example, if we were building a game, a specific module may handle physics, while another handles what is rendered on screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python a module is simply a file with a `.py` extension, containing functions, variables and classes. When we import this code into Python we use the name of the file without the extension. For example, a file called *test.py* defines a module and its corresponding name in Python would be *test*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python ships with a relatively large collection of useful modules, such as `math`, however, we can also define our own modules or download them from a third-party.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are simply collections of modules and packages, within a directory. To be a package a special `__init__.py` file must exist indicating that the directory defines a package. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "audio/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    formats/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        mp3.py\n",
    "        wav.py\n",
    "    effects/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        echo.py\n",
    "        fade.py  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above package structure defines a package `audio` containing a further two packages; `formats` and `effects`. The `formats` package contains two modules `mp3` and `wav` while the `effects` package defines two modules `echo` and `fade`. In this notebbok we will not dwell on the structure of packages, although it helps to understand how they are laid out. If you would like to learn more about packages and how to create them, I suggest taking a look at the extra resources linked below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python ships with an extensive [collection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) of modules/packages useful to a programmer. It is important for a programmer to become acquainted with the standard library as it can be used to solve many common programming problems quickly, without having to write and test new code. There is a nice guide to the standard library available on the Python website [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/stdlib.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Party Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the Python standard library is by no means comprehensive, hence, third party components can be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI). Here you can find everything from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks! The scientific community also often use a software called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as it also allows the easy installation of more complex packages which may also make use of compiled code (C, C++, Rust, etc...). If you are viewing these notebooks with Binder, it has taken care of installing a number of third-party extensions that we will use in these sessions.\n",

    "### What are functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are an integral part of Python and most other programming languages, bundling blocks of reusable code that performs a paticular task. When carrying out a paticular task a function may or may not require multiple inputs and when finished may or may not return multiple outputs. Programmers often use functions to prevent re-writing multiple lines of code or break up complex processes making code much easier to read and debug. In Python there are three main types of function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) such as `print()`, and `min()`/`max()` *(We have come across these in the previous notebook)*\n",
    "- User defined functions (UDFs), created by a user\n",
    "- Anonymous functions, or `lambda` functions which are not declared using the keyword `def`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to create your own functions to perform various tasks.\n",

    "## The Anatomy of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python functions are declared using the keyword `def`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add two numbers (x, y) and return the result\"\"\"\n",
    "    result = x + y\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above function consists of the follwing components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The keyword `def` that declares the following lines as a function.\n",
    "2. A function name *`add_numbers`*, giving a unique identifier to the function *(just like how we would name a variable)*\n",
    "3. Parameters/arguments *`(x, y)`* specifying what data we wish to provide the function. These are optional although the brackets myst always exist i.e. `def no_arg_function():`\n",
    "4. A colon `:` to mark the end of the function declaration.\n",
    "5. Optional function description (*docstring*).\n",
    "6. One or more lines of Python code, making up the function body. These lines should be indented to mark that they are part of the function (tab/four spaces). \n",
    "7. An optional `return` statement to return a value from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a function is defined we can use it with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add_numbers(1, 2)\n",
    "# we can assign the returned value to a variable like so\n",
    "sum_result = add_numbers(1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

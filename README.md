## Getting started

The workshop materials are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MEDC0106/PythonWorkshop). You can run them directly online using either **Google Colab** (requires a Google account but loads quickly) or **Binder** (no login needed, though it may take several minutes to start). Use the buttons above to launch your preferred option.

## Workshop format

The workshop runs over three sessions combining short lectures and self-paced practicals. Each session builds on the previous one. Start with the introductory notebooks before attempting the exercises. We will review the previous session’s exercises at the start of each class.  
By the end of the workshop, you should feel confident writing and running Python code, and understand its applications in bioinformatics and data analysis. All material remains available online if you wish to revisit it later.

    1. (01) Introduction to Python
    2. (02) Functions
    3. (03) Modules and packages

- **Session 2** (Bioinformatics with BioPython)
    1. (05) Handling sequences with Biopython
    2. (06) Exercises
    3. (07) Handling protein data with Biopython (supplementary material)

## Getting Started

To get started with the workshop please click here: [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MEDC0106/PythonWorkshop).

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use Colab, click the following link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MEDC0106/PythonWorkshop/main).
Binder may take ~10 minutes to load, although there is nothing you will need to install on your local
computer.

## Workshop format

This workshop takes place over three sessions, consisting of a set of introductory notebooks and exercises to complete.
You should complete the introductory notebooks in the current session before attempting the excersises, unless you are
already comfortable with the material. The exercises contain a mix of easy to challenging tasks. Do not worry if you 
struggle to complete some exercises, we will go over them at the begining of the next session.

- **Session 1** (Introduction to Python)
    1. (01) Introduction to Python
    2. (02) Functions
    3. (03) Modules and packages 
    4. (04) Exercises

- **Session 2** (Bioinformatics with BioPython)
    1. (05) Handling sequences with Biopython
    2. (06) Exercises
    3. (07) Handling protein data with Biopython (supplementary material)
    4. (08) Supplementary exercises

- **Session 3** (Introduction to Data Analysis)
    1. (09) Pandas
    2. (10) Exercises
    3. (11) NumPy (supplementary material)
    4. (12) Predictive modelling (supplementary material)
    5. (13) Supplementary exercises

By the end of these sessions you should feel more confident about programming with Python and understand the application
of programming and Python to specific domains. Hopefully you will feel encouraged to learn more and use
Python in your research or future career.

All the material in these sessions is freely available if you wish to come back to it at a later date to refresh
your knowledge.
